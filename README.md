# rtc

Working on scultping out an web rtc om component.

Currently a (barely) working example of using clojure/clojurescript to coordinate two peer connections with a data channel.

Uses Om for client side rendering.

*Totally almost there, you guys.*

As of now, the example works--it's just very non-obvious how. My bad. Will keep chiseling.

## Prerequisites
